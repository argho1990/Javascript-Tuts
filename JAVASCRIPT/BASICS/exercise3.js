//Objects:
// ->Javascript is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
// ->You can write code and model your programming structure using Objects.
// ->So we will look at how objects works at Javascript.
// ->Will also look at how objects work in javascript and will aslo compare and constrast it
// ->with the way objects work in some of the other classical languages.
// ->Will recover this the javascript is an object oriented langauge.


// Javascript is an Object Oriented Programming Language but however it is not a class-based 
// programming language.
// Contrast this with a language like java where you have classes which define objects.
// In order to create an object what you need to do is create a class first,add member variables.
// add methods to it and then when you create objects off a particular class,I want this object to be off 
// a class so the class forms the template and then all these different objects are basically copies off that 
// template this works in a lot of class based object oriented programming languages.
// However in the case of javascript,there are no classes it is not a class-based object oriented programming 
// language so you can create objects without having classes in fact its necessary because its there are no
// classes in javascript,so javascript objects are essentially free form,they are not bound to a particular class.
